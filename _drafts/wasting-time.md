# Stop Wasting Your Time

Forget the snooze button
Don't do stuff for too long
 - eg. taking a bath...
 - track everything you can.
timetables, scheduling
Stay focused -> You will finish stuff faster -> you will have more time to relax.
Sleep well.
 - if you don't sleep well, then you will be tired -> you won't be efficient -> you waste your time
 - stop using stimulants (coffee, alcohol)
 - chill down your mind
   - drink a glass of wine... do something else...
 - try to meditate
