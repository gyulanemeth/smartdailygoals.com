   - or just schedule things in a way that they are not there
Social media

Co-workers -> is open-office good?

       - "A good example would be a software developer who just can’t trace a bug so they put it aside and let it incubate. The answer may come back to the software developer later while he or she is working on another task. This is an example of how switching tasks may be beneficial."
       - "What advice do you give to people who feel like they can’t keep up?

Limit your web usage. Be disciplined. I am the most productive if I limit web usage to twice per day, once in the morning and once at night. To be more realistic, it’s usually like four times a day that I check e-mail. If I do that, I can be really productive."

 "A distraction is an alert  says, 'Orient your attention here now; this could be dangerous.'" The brain's reaction is automatic and virtually unstoppable.

 Counter to common belief, you can't do two cognitively complicated tasks at once, Meyer says. When you're on the phone and writing an e-mail at the same time, you're actually switching back and forth between them, since there's only one mental and neural channel through which language flows. "If you have a complicated task, it requires all your attention, and if you're trying to spread your attention over multiple tasks, it's not going to work," he says.

 They refer the original work: https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/xhp274763.pdf

 Meyer admits that multitasking is not only getting more prevalent, but it's also "very often highly inefficient and can be dangerous to your health." --> even burnout

 In fact, trying to complete two or more tasks at once can take 50 percent more time or longer, depending on the complexity of the tasks, Meyer says.

 "If you want to be a creative entrepreneur, you ought to be setting aside large chunks of time where you just think," he says. "Einstein was not multitasking when he was dreaming up the special and general theories of relativity."

 - willpower -> muscle, train it

 - 23 minutes to recover from distraction
   - social busybodies :D :D

 - "It's also important to know your triggers. For instance, I know I'm highly visual. I can be intensely focused on a task and not hear a sound, but if there's a television display in my field of vision, I can't help but look. Other people I know can have a wall of screens in front of them and not blink, but someone talking behind them can cause them to use earplugs."
  - "Establish office "focus time" for certain hours of the day or days of the week where everyone agrees not to bother or distract people."

“Network tools [like social media, email, the Internet] are distracting us from work that requires unbroken concentration, while simultaneously degrading our capacity to remain focused.” -Cal Newport
 - how to consistently enter flow states
   - “When you build a habit, you don’t have to spend mental energy deciding what to do.”
 - reinvest your free time... do sports, read a book...
   - wasting time... 
 - Develop your ability to ignore almost everything
   - "Of course, anything can be construed to fit these requirements; email is “essential.” Working overtime is nonnegotiable. Watching that TV show is a “must-see.” You “can’t miss” going out for drinks again. But when you really, truly analyze these “essential” and “crucial” obligations, you realize they have virtually no impact on your future. They don’t expand your life. They don’t contribute to your legacy."
   - "Your ability to ignore irrelevance is just as important as your ability to focus on priorities."
"Remember, what we tolerate is what we get."
“Successful people do what unsuccessful people are unwilling to do.”

  - "For example, a university of London study (link is external) found that being always connected impacts your IQ equivalent to losing a night's sleep or taking up marijuana."
  - office distractions: average: 2.1hours/day!!!
  - other study: 11 minutes on project, distraction, 25 minutes to get back if they do at all
  - having an idea is also a distraction to be managed... ---- mind sweep???

  - remove temptation: switch off all communication devices!!!

  - breaking system in brain - helps you to kizár egyéb things (inhibiting distractions)
   "To avoid distractions it's helpful to get into the habit of stopping the wrong behaviors early, quickly, and often, well before they take over."
   "And here's a big take away from all this. Manage what you focus on. Pay attention to your attention, and stop yourself from getting on the wrong train of thought early, before it takes over. This is the oppositive of being mindless: it's being mindful."
    - start with the though work... leave the brainless stuff to the end of the day...
 "So in summary, how do you beat back distractions? Turn everything off. And do your deeper thinking work in the morning while you still have the ability to control your attention. Sounds easy enough. In practice it's tough, but it works."


https://goinswriter.com/distraction/ - van benne egy-két jó gondolat, de a distraction-ről nem sok igazából.
 - slow down: "If we reserve our joy only for the experiences of a lifetime, we may miss the life in the experience."
 - choosing to be grateful, anyway: "Our culture has conditioned us to expect instant results and overnight success. But life doesn’t always work that way."
    "Our cultural impatience runs so rampant that we dress it up in terms like “productivity” and “efficiency.” But what’s really happening is we are conditioning ourselves to get what we want now, all the time. Such a mindset robs us of the lessons waiting can teach us, causing us to miss out on the slow but important stuff of life." ... hát, ez kicsit fura.
 - how we grow: "embrace the “long game” of life"
 - Three things that will make you happier now
   - make a gratitude list
   - stop competing
   - resist the urge of distraction

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distraction
 - rohadt jó a definíció :) az okok felsorolása is
 - also mentions multitasking in the "In workplace" section
 
https://www.themuse.com/advice/stop-being-so-hard-on-yourself-for-getting-distracted-at-work
 - they say that it's okay to get distracted... reasoning: social interactions needed -> at the end of the day the output will be bigger with some distractions (they enjoy the day, etc)
