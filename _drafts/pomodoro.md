Sounds simple, right? Well, first try it and we will see.

 - focus, don't get distracted
   - no social media, no phones, no notifications, no random articles (just close or ignore everything unrelated)
   - no distracting teammates
   - the 2 hour cycle should be untacted
   - toilet break, drinking, etc -> try to do them while you are having a break
   - inner distractions!
     - you start biting your nails
     - your imagination starts wondering
     - cease "doing nothing" periods
- estimate how many pomodoros you need to achieve something
  - too nmany? might need to decompose your task
- Plan what you wanna do!
  - you might have a longer time period...
  - you can use one pomodoro for this!
 - try to achieve something meaningful by the end of every pomodoro
   - Mindset: need to achieve by the end of every Pomodoro
    - continuously give deadlines for yourself
 - Track your progress! - how many pomodoros you estimated and how many did you spend.
   - did you really focused? were there any distractions? Did you just lógat your leg?
 - Pomodoro for the whole team?
