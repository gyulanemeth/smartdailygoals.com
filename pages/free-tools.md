There are a few tools I want to create and share with you here. Most of them are in the idea phase, so they can still evolve in many different directions. I would love to hear your thoughts and ideas.

## [Pompom Pomodoro Timer](http://smartdailygoals.com/pompom-pomodoro-timer/)

As the title suggests, it's a Pomodoro Timer. Simple, but (as far as I know) works on most of the devices.

Upcoming feature: I want to turn it into a chrome extension. When you have focusing time, only whitelisted pages will be allowed.

## Timtim Time Tracker

Idea phase.

A simple time tracker where you can set a few properties for every timebox you track:
 - what did you do
 - what was your related role
 - whom did you work with
 - moreover, you will be able to tag your timeboxes

There will be no possibility to add a timebox which is less than 15 minutes. I genuinely believe that if you switch between tasks so rapidly, then the output will be very close to zero. That is why these kinds of timeboxes will automatically get the "randoming" flag.

## Really? Reality Checker

Idea phase.

Many people want to do a lot of stuff to reach their different goals. In many cases, they don't realize how much time it takes to achieve something. This tool will be a simple visualization tool which will make help you to come up with realistic plans.

## Goalie Goal Tracker

Idea phase.

This idea has a lot to do with the previous one. It's the tracker version of the that. Also, there are multiple things you repeatedly do, but sometimes you just skip a few of these... Well, that might not be a problem in short-term, but can have drastic effects on long-term.

I want to introduce some gamification, like badges and streaks. These tools work perfectly in other software, for example, DuoLingo.
