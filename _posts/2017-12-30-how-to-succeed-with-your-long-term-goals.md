For many people, New Year's Eve is the time when they set goals for the next year, but many of them miserably fail. But Why?

Maybe they are not determined enough? Or the goals are not realistic?

There can be multiple reasons, but one thing is sure. If you don't do it right, your goals will remain dreams. In this article, I am going to show you a simple method with which you can reach your goals. I hope you will succeed, and your goals will not remain imaginations, but they will come true.

## What are the Typical Reasons for Personal Goal Setting?

Whenever people set goals, they are **not satisfied** with something. They obviously want to change it, so they set goals which they want to reach.

Although everybody does it, in many cases it's **not a conscious goal setting**. They often just think (or dream) about a state they want to reach.

Since the motivation for personal goal setting comes from inside, the typical reasons are usually very straightforward. People want to be **happier**, smarter, want more excitement, be **healthier** or they want to be **more attractive**.

There may be other reasons - for example, status or more money -, but I think the ones above are the most typical ones.

## General Long-Term Goals

Many of us have more specific goals than being happy or smarter, but they are still very general. These goals can drive our lives for years or even for decades.

These goals change over time. It's evident that you have different goals when you are a student, when you have been on the job market for a while, and when you are retired. These goals are also determined by the place where you were born, in what kind of education you participated, your current financial status or your relationship status. These are just examples, but there are many more factors which can affect your long-term goals.

Just to give you an example, I will share with you my long-term personal goals.

 - I want to speak Chinese.
 - I want to be very, very fit.
 - I want to make this blog successful.

I think you can figure out the motivation behind my general long-term goals, but let's  discuss them in a few words.

If I speak Chinese, I am considered to be smarter. Thus I'm more attractive to a lot of people. It's the second most important language in the world, so it can be beneficial financially and can bring me tons of opportunities. But to be honest, my primary motivation is that I fell in love with the language. There are two reasons for it. The first is that it is very, very different from any language that I have learned, the second is that there are no latin words in it. (Unlike all of the European languages.)

The motivation behind my second long-term goal is that I want to stay healthy and want to be more attractive to others. Duh, why else would someone want to be very fit?

My third goal is to make this blog successful. There are multiple reasons for it. The first is that I have always been a productivity freak and I think I have developed easy-to-follow methods which can help others as well. The second reason is that I'm very interested in how to make a lifestyle blog successful. It also involves a **sub-goal** that I want to understand how social media works. And you know what they say... Learning by doing is the best. For now, the motivation behind is that I want to learn. On a long run, it may have financial benefits, but it would be far-fetched to talk about money, in the first post of an experimental blog, wouldn't it?

## Typical Types of Goal Setting

As I was thinking about what types of goal settings there are, I compiled a list of three typical types:

People usually want to want to **acquire new skills or develop the existing ones**. For example, learning a new language - Chinese in my case -, a martial art, or programming.
 
Many people want to **change their habits**. The most common example is when they want to **quit a bad habit**, for example, quit smoking or drinking, or you want to drink less coffee. The opposite is when you want to **pick up a new habit**, for example, to get up one hour every day to do something to reach your goals.

The last category which came to my mind is when people want to **reach a certain state**. For example, you want to get a degree, want to be an astronaut, or you want to earn one million dollars.

The third group contains bigger goals which can you can reach by reaching sub-goals whereas, in the first two categories, you can find smaller goals which will lead to your primary objectives.

## SMART Goal Setting

Setting goals are crucial, but what's more important is to reach them. There is a straightforward method in management theory which helps you to achieve your goals, and you can apply it to your personal development as well. Every goal you set has to pass the [**SMART criteria**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria) which is an acronym for:

 - **S**pecific
 - **M**easurable
 - **A**ctionable
 - **R**ealistic
 - **T**ime-bound

Let's see if my goals which I wrote about two sections ago pass the SMART criteria or not:

 - I want to speak Chinese: it's not specific nor measurable because I did not tell anything about the level. Because of this and because I did not set any deadlines, I can't know if it's realistic. Is it actionable? Well, I don't think so.
 - I want to be very, very fit: Well, the problems are the same.
 - I want to make this blog successful: Okay, what is the measure of success? How would I do that? In what time frame?

If you think about your goals and they don't pass these criteria, then you have to think about breaking them down into smaller pieces.

## How to Break Down Your Long-term Goals Into Smaller Ones Which Pass the SMART Criteria

There are some cases, when the sequence of sub-goals are pre-determined, for example if you want to get a degree, you have to pass certain exams. The hard thing is, when you have to come up with this sequence of sub-goals.

Many people set yearly goals, which is already a good start. This way, your goal is already **time-bound**. You can also define **milestones** when you can make sure that you are on track to reach your yearly goals. An easy way to do is to set 3-month goals, which you can divide into monthly, weekly and even daily goals. (Guess where the name of the website comes from.)

If you manage to define daily goals, then you successfully decomposed your incredibly huge goal to **small feasable steps**. You don't necessarily need to go down to daily level, but I think it's preferable.

When you have the time constraints, you have to define **specific and measurable** goals that will lead you towards your bigger goals and dreams. For example get a certificate of your skill, instead of only saying that you master that skill.

After that, you can think about breaking it down to **actionable** parts, which is usually leads you to a daily level planning. There is two very important questions to answer:

 - How will you do it? (On a monthly, weekly, and daily level.)
 - How much time are you willing to allocate to it? What's your schedule?

If you answered these questions you will be able to tell if your plan is **realistic** or not. If it's not realistic, then change the speific and measurable goal to something more feasable or if you are very determined, change your **action plan**. You can allocate more time to it or you can figure out alternative methods to reach your goal.

After you did this iteration with all of your goals, you should **make sure that all of your goals together are feasable**. It's much better to achieve one thing than not achieveing many, so I suggest you to **focus only on a few things** or target for **smaller goals**.

## Examples of SMART Goal Setting

In this section I am going to show you how to do it in practice. I am going to use my previous examples and break them down into SMART goals. I won't show you each and every detail here and I won't be blogging about my results here. If you want to follow that as well, follow me on tumblr.

### SMART Goal Setting for Language Learning

Instead of saying "I want to speak Chinese" I can say "I want to pass an HSK3 test next December." (HSK3 is a standard basic level Chinese language exam.)

The second statement is **specific**, **measurable** and **time-bound**. I haven't tried any Chinese language exam yet, but I know that I'm somewhere between HSK1 and HSK2. It is needless to say that I can add a **milestone** here, which is an HSK2 language exam. There is one this spring, so I have approximately 12-15 weeks to prepare for that. I feel that the first milestone is **realistic**. The second milestone sounds scarier, but it's not unrealistic. I will have 30 weeks to finish a 15 chapter book, which seems to be very hard, but feasable.

But here comes the question. How am I going to do it? How much time will I invest?

I'm planning to invest half an hour every morning on weekdays to write down example dialogs, which I will review and practice after lunch. This sounds like an **action plan**.

### SMART Goal Setting for Fitness

Instead of saying "I want to be very, very fit", I can say "I want to run the [Jakarta marathon](http://thejakartamarathon.com/) on the 29th of October".

It's also **specific, measurable and time bound**. I have run a marathon already, so it's **realistic**. I can easily add milestones, for example some half-marathons with desired finish times throughout the year.

The **action plan** here is extremely simple. Run at least once every week and increase the amount of running week by week. At the beginning once per week is enough. I will see if it's enough when I will run very long distances. If it's not enough, then I will have to increase the number of weekly runst to 2 or 3.

There is one thing I need to mention here. I had problems with my knees after running my first marathon, so if I experience those problems again, I won't run the marathon. If your health is on stake, you definitely have to change your goals immediately.

### SMART Goal Setting for Blogging

Instead of saying "I want to make Smart Daily Goals successful" I can say "I want to reach 1000 likes on Facebook and 1000 twitter followers by the end of the year".

Again, it's **specific, measurable and time-bound**. To be honest, I have no idea if it's **realistic** or not. I need to invest some time to see if it's feasable or not. If it is not, I will need to change my plan.

How I want to do it? What's my **action plan**? Well, I want to publish meaningful articles every month, which can help people to be more successful. I don't want to waste my time on articles which are not interesting for people, so I am going to test on Facebook which topics are more attractive to my readers than others.

I also want to share bits of information from the articles on Twitter as a reminder for my audience.

The final thing I want to do is to show my results on Tumblr as an evidence that these methods work. I don't want to do it on this blog, because I feel that it's much more personal for this website. I feel I need to separate these two things.


## Summary

Almost finished.
