As a "Pomodoro-maniac" I've been practicing this productivity technique for quite a while. I've tried it out many different ways in many different environments, so I believe my experience might be interesting for others.

This article is not a one-time article which you publish, and then nothing happens. I want this article to evolve. Whenever I find out something new about this technique that's worth sharing, I will do so.

Most of the articles I find online are just general descriptions, and they don't go into details of how to use this technique effectively or when you shouldn't use it. Well, I believe writing about that can be useful for many people. Also, if you have any suggestions about the content, please let me know below in the comments section.

Besides that this productivity method helps you finish your tasks, it also helps you to fulfill your long-term goals. It helps you to learn to focus which is one of the most important things when it comes to making your dreams real.

Since I'm very much into this technique, I've started working on a simple Pomodoro Timer as a hobby project. It's called [Pompom Pomodoro Timer](http://smartdailygoals.com/pompom-pomodoro-timer/) at the moment. I have many ideas about the further development, but your feedback is even more critical. One time opportunity: I will invite the first ten people for a beer who give me valuable feedback about my Pomodoro Timer. :)

## So, What is the Pomodoro Technique?

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method, which helps you to get your things done. It breaks down your time into intervals of so-called Pomodoros. Each Pomodoro consists of two parts. First, you **focus** on a specific task for 25 minutes which is followed by a short, - traditionally - 5-minute **break**. Every fourth break is more extended, for example, 15 or 30 minutes.

The original inventor of the technique used tomato shape kitchen-timers, from which the name of the method comes. (Pomodoro means tomato in Italian, that's where the name comes from.)

1) First, you need to choose a task to work on.
2) Set the timer to 25 minutes
3) Work on the task until timer rings (Ideally there are nothing that distracts you from the job.)
4) Take a short break (eg.: 5 minutes). Every fourth break can be longer. (15-25 minutes.)
5) Repeat.

This simple method is excellent. Just think about it. Who couldn't focus for 25 minutes? Anybody can do it with some determination. It means that if you master this technique, you can be continuously productive.

Also, this technique introduces frequent - but short - breaks, which helps your brain to remain refreshed. Also, it's a great time to do your bathroom break or check your emails. In the longer breaks, you might even have coffee, or lunch or whatever that takes more time.

## What are the Benefits of the Pomodoro Technique?

The most apparent benefit I love is that I can finish tons of things when I practice this technique. There are three main reasons for it.

 - The first reason is straightforward: it helps you to **focus** on a particular task, which is beneficial if you want to finish stuff.
 - The second is that it has a **deadline effect**. You feel the urge to accomplish something by the end of your Pomodoro(s).
 - The third reason is that it helps you to **[get into the flow](https://blog.mindvalley.com/how-to-focus/)**. When it happens, it's much easier to accomplish whatever you do.

The other benefit I like is that this technique frequently gives my brain some time to refresh. It means that you will be able to finish a lot of work without getting exhausted.


## How to Use the Pomodoro Technique Effectively?
The benefits sound great, the technique seems to be ridiculously simple, but many people make some mistakes which prevent this simple method to be effective. I've identified some of these mistakes.

### Stick to Your Pomodoros

Many people don't stick to their Pomodoros. They don't start it regularly, and they don't hold to the time-boxes. It means that these people don't use this technique.

My first rule of the Pomodoro technique might be familiar from an ad: "Just do it." If you have started using the Pomodoro technique that's already a good sign. Now, you need to stick to it. Focus on the thing you choose to work on and try to get used to the rhythm of the technique.

When it's focus time, work on your task. Try not to do anything else; there are enough breaks for those other things.

Try to use this technique every day. When it becomes a habit, it will be much easier to do it well. Also, your environment will even get used to it and leave you alone in your focusing time.

### Cease Distraction

As we live in a world full of distractions, so it might be hard, but if you want to focus on your stuff to finish it, you have to eliminate everything distracting you. A [study](https://lifehacker.com/how-long-it-takes-to-get-back-on-track-after-a-distract-1720708353) says whenever you are distracted, it takes more than 20 minutes on average to get back to where you were. From this perspective, it sounds like a lot of wasted time. It might be a good idea to introduce distraction-free time periods in your days.

I thought a lot about this topic, and I identified three main categories of distraction:
 - tech-related
 - people-related
 - inner-distractions

To mention a few things that you can do to overcome these distractions:
 - turn of notifications on your phone (tech)
 - turn of desktop notifications (tech)
 - close unnecessary tabs in your browser (tech)
 - ask people around you to respect your focus time (people)
 - whenever your thoughts start wondering, try to get back to the task you are focusing on (inner)
 - try to drink water and go to the bathroom during the breaks - so you won't have to do those during your focusing time (inner)

Some of these sound ridiculous or impossible to overcome, but no matter how you put it: a distraction is a distraction. I don't say that there are no exceptions, sometimes you can - or have to - break your focus time. There are always urgent situations that need an immediate reaction. When it's a must, do it, but still, keep in mind that any distraction is decreasing your effectiveness.

### Try to Achieve Something Meaningful in Every Pomodoro

If you do your Pomodoros, but you don't know what you want to achieve by the end of your focus times, then there is a chance that you won't do it as effectively as you could. Even worse, you might work on a lot of stuff, but you don't go in any direction.

If you give deadlines to yourself, then you will feel the urge to finish the actual task. Luckily, there are time-boxes in this technique, so if you set [actionable and measurable goals](http://smartdailygoals.com/2017/12/30/how-to-succeed-with-your-long-term-goals.html) for every Pomodoro, then the deadline-effect will continuously help you to be very, very efficient. Nevertheless, it also helps you to decompose your task into smaller bits that you can finish in a single Pomodoro. If you reach your goals Pomodoro by Pomodoro, then you can be sure that you are going in the right direction. Don't worry if you can't finish things in time in the beginning; you will get there.

### Plan, Estimate, Track and Evaluate Your Progress

If you already set goals for yourself in every Pomodoro, then you are only a step away from planning your whole day or even your whole week based on Pomodoros. I suggest you to start doing it daily. You can use your first Pomodoro for planning your full day. Estimate how many Pomodoros are needed to sort out your tasks. Whenever you finish a Pomodoro, take a note about what you did. You can use a sheet of paper for that; it's only essential that you do it. Hopefully, after a while, your estimations will be closer and closer to reality, which means that you can adequately plan the progress of your tasks. Believe me, most of the people are very, very bad at that. Hopefully, you will be much above the average.

### Give Enough Time to Get Into the Flow

It's great if you focus on a specific task for 25 minutes. Probably you can finish a lot if you concentrate. But in many cases, this amount of time is barely enough to figure out where to continue the thing you ended last time. That is why I like to assign four Pomodoros for a particular topic. Some tasks may not require that many Pomodoros, but I'm pretty sure that you have similar issues to sort out. It's much, much better to deal with them in the same batch.

I use the Pomodoro technique in the mornings before work as part of my daily routine. I make a Pomodoro sprint (4 Pomodoros) every morning. Previously, I used to do four different things in each Pomodoro, but it did not work, because I had to do context switches in every half an hour. Nowadays, I still do four Pomodoros in the morning, but I dedicate all of them to a particular topic (for example writing this article). This way my brain does not have to switch in between various things and I have the chance to get into the [flow](https://blog.mindvalley.com/how-to-focus/) which is a great feeling and helps me to finish even more.

## Summary

The Pomodoro Technique is a widely used, straightforward time-boxing method, which can help you to finish much more in much less time. It uses 25-minute long focusing time divided by short breaks. Every fourth break is more extended than the others, so it divides your time into a little bit longer than two-hour sprints. In these two hour long periods you should focus on one topic or multiple similar tasks. This way you can get into a state called the [flow](https://blog.mindvalley.com/how-to-focus/).

The number one rule of this technique is to stick to it. If you can do that, then try to avoid every type of distractions (tech, people, and inner-distractions). Try to achieve something in every single Pomodoro, to benefit from the deadline effect. Try to plan your days with Pomodoros and try to incorporate it into your daily routine.

This whole thing sounds to be very simple, but to be honest, it needs a lot of practice. So don't be hard on yourself, it might need some time to get used to it. Try to do it over and over again. Be resilient, and don't give up! I promise you that it will pay off.
