So you have been working on your amazing project for a while when the phone rang. Your mother called you to tell you that the family is invited to Uncle Joe's wedding. This is great! You are very happy that your uncle finally found his partner. You start to think about your love and how you met...

But wait, let's get back to work. This thing has to be done, you know that it helps your career, you are aligned with the ideas that this project means, and you feel satisfaction whenever you achieve the next milestone in this project.

Finally, you start to work again. It takes a few minutes to get back to where you were previously, and you can finally make some progress. Suddenly a teammate enters the room, says hi and starts to talk about the game last night.

Great, you have to get back to where you were again. And then you glance at your phone because it buzzed. It's probably important; notifications have to be important. When you unlock your phone, you realize that you also got tons of messages that you need to answer.

When you are finished with those critical things on your phone, you realize that a few hours have gone and you barely progressed with your beloved project. On top of all of these, screaming kids start running around in the building...

Sound familiar, right? People waste tons of time because of [distractions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distraction). We live in the era of distractions. Every company and many people want your attention, but if you want to be successful, you need to choose what to focus on.

This article is focusing on external distractions. Luckily, it's easy to do something against external distractions, so bear with me. I am also going to write about internal distractions in a forthcoming article, so if you are interested in that subject, please come back a little bit later.

## How Distraction Works

Being distracted is your biggest enemy when you want to be productive. It can be tough to fight against it because it's an automatic reaction in many cases.

 > "A distraction is an alert says, 'Orient your attention here now; this could be dangerous.'" The brain's reaction is automatic and virtually unstoppable. [entrepreneur.com](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/225321)

It would not be a problem at all if we could get back to where we were instantaneously, but it's not the case at all. It can take up [23 minutes to recover](https://lifehacker.com/how-long-it-takes-to-get-back-on-track-after-a-distract-1720708353) from a distraction. Just think about it. It might have happened to you that you wanted to get back to work after being distracted and you were like "Okay, where was I?"

Since in most of the cases being distracted is a reaction to something, it's relatively easy to fight against it: **cease the source of the distraction**.

Easier said than done, but let me guide you through how you can fight against external distractions.

## Distracting Environment

It's essential to stay in a calm environment where you can focus. It can be a silent environment or one where there are no visual distractions. It depends on you; you have to know what things distract you the most.

> "It's also important to know your triggers. For instance, I know I'm highly visual. I can be intensely focused on a task and not hear a sound, but if there's a television display in my field of vision, I can't help but look. Other people I know can have a wall of screens in front of them and not blink, but someone talking behind them can cause them to use earplugs." [inc.com](https://www.inc.com/bruce-eckfeldt/18-ways-to-avoid-being-distracted-at-work.html)

For example, I love to go to coffee places to get things done, but that might not work for many people because there might be many people walking around, talking and doing stuff. I am also easily distracted by someone talking, but I usually put on my **headphones** and start **listening to music that helps me focus**. Also, at home, I have a small **desk facing towards the corner** of a room so that I can lock out visual distractions. This table is very, very small, so I can't even put many things in it that might be distracting. 

So you can do a lot against distracting environments to a certain extent, but for those who want to be hyper-focused, I don't recommend open offices or public places. If you go to work in a café (like I do in many cases), try to find a quiet corner where you can be on your own.

## Distracting People Around You

In many situations, some people might distract you from the thing what you are focusing on. It can be the love of your life at home or ["social busybodies"](https://www.inc.com/bruce-eckfeldt/18-ways-to-avoid-being-distracted-at-work.html) at your workplace. Whichever the case is, you must make sure that they **respect your focusing time**.

It might be tricky in both situations. What worked me at home is that I agreed with my girlfriend not to be distracted while I'm doing my [Pomodoros'](http://smartdailygoals.com/2018/07/02/the-pomodoro-technique-in-practice.html) focusing intervals. We communicate while I'm having a break.

Similarly, you can establish [focusing time at the office](https://www.inc.com/bruce-eckfeldt/18-ways-to-avoid-being-distracted-at-work.html) where everyone agrees that they don't distract each other. An alternative to this can be a dedicated **focusing room** where the most important rule is that nobody distracts each other.

With a previous team, we even tried out synchronizing the whole team's focusing times and breaks with a [Pomodoro Timer](http://smartdailygoals.com/pompom-pomodoro-timer/). It worked great for that team, but I doubt that every team can adopt this habit.

It's also quite frequent that people call or text you when it's entirely not urgent. The simple solution to avoid this type of distraction is to **answer later** after you finished your focusing time.

> "And don’t worry if you offend anyone. People usually form the habit of calling or texting you even when it’s not urgent. So set some rules and ask them to take it seriously. Over time, they will because it’s respectful." [blog.mindvalley.com](https://blog.mindvalley.com/how-to-focus/)

It's not obligatory to answer right away. In most of the cases, it's entirely okay to do it a little bit later. That is why it's a great idea to use a **chat software** - for example Slack - in the office as the primary communication channel. That way you can ask questions from your teammates without interrupting them. In most of the cases, you don't need the answer immediately, so it does not make sense to go there and make them stop what they are doing at the moment. Using these kinds of software makes the whole team much more productive.

A final tip to avoid getting distracted by others: if you have your own room, [then close the door](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/223812). If someone enters, stand up and discuss what's needs to be addressed without sitting down. People tend to finish faster if they can't sit down.

## Technology is the Biggest Source of Distraction

We were discussing "social busybodies" in the last section. They tend to be very distractive online as well, but you also get tons of notifications on your phone from applications. Everybody wants your attention, especially companies who make money on you eventually. The worst thing of all is that this whole thing makes you stupid:

> "A University of London study found that being always connected impacts your IQ equivalent to losing a night's sleep or taking up marijuana." [psychologytoday.com](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/your-brain-work/200910/easily-distracted-why-its-hard-focus-and-what-do-about-it)

Luckily, it's straightforward to fight against these kinds of distractions: **turn off push notifications**, **turn off desktop notifications** and put your phone on your desk facing down. (You can even turn it off.) Also, you definitely should **close unrelated tabs** in your browser. Many tabs can also draw your attention plus it might be hart do find those that matter.

Also, as I mentioned in the previous section, it's okay to **postpone answering** to other people. I usually do it when I'm having a break or going to the bathroom.

It might sound drastic to limit your online presence these days, but believe me, it makes you much, much more productive.

> "Limit your web usage. Be disciplined. I am the most productive if I limit web usage to twice per day, once in the morning and once at night. To be more realistic, it’s usually like four times a day that I check e-mail. If I do that, I can be really productive."

## Can Distraction or Interruption be Beneficial?

Social interactions are definitely needed between human beings. An [article](https://www.themuse.com/advice/stop-being-so-hard-on-yourself-for-getting-distracted-at-work) even states that it's okay to be distracted. They say that at the end of the day the output will be bigger with some distractions. The reasoning is that people will enjoy what they do, and they won't feel like robots.

It absolutely makes sense! There has to be enough time every day when people can have random chit-chatting about totally unrelated things. Also, on many occasions, they talk about work-related stuff, and in many cases, the best ideas arise during these informal interactions.

I think every team has to find a healthy balance of focusing time and "randoming time". Eventually, the output is what matters. When team members are not happy, the output will decrease.

## Summary

External distractions are the biggest enemies of being productive. Be it a noisy environment, a talkative co-worker, or push notifications on your phone, these things draw your attention immediately, because your brain is wired in that way.

In many cases, it takes much time to get back to where you were previously so that you might lose several hours of valuable time every day.

You can read some ideas about how to overcome these distractions, but if you have anything to add, please share it in the comments section below.

Although distractions generally decrease productivity, you have to be careful not to overdo ceasing them, because, for example, social interactions are general needs of human beings. People need to have some random interactions to feel good, and when you feel good, you perform better.
